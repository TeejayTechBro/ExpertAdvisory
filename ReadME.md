## Introduction

This Expert Advisor (EA) project focuses on utilizing historical financial data for making trading decisions. It employs correlation analysis to identify potential relationships between various financial instruments and implements a reinforcement learning (RL) model to optimize trading strategies based on historical price movements.

## Features
Historical Data Analysis: The EA processes historical data of different financial instruments to extract meaningful insights and trends.

## Correlation Analysis:
 Identifies correlations between different financial instruments to help in portfolio diversification and risk management.

## Reinforcement Learning Model: 
Implements an RL model that learns from historical data to make trading decisions and adapts its strategy over time.

## Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/teejayX18/ea-historical-rl.git
cd ea-historical-rl
Install required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the data preprocessing script to prepare the historical data:

Copy code
python preprocess_data.py
Execute the correlation analysis script to identify instrument correlations:

Copy code
python correlation_analysis.py
Train and deploy the reinforcement learning model using the provided RL framework:

Copy code
python train_rl_model.py
Data
The historical financial data used in this project can be found in the data directory. It includes datasets of various financial instruments in CSV format.

## Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis investigates the relationships between financial instruments. Results and insights from this analysis are available in the correlation_results directory.

## Reinforcement Learning Model
The reinforcement learning model is implemented using the TensorFlow RL framework. The model's architecture, training configuration, and performance evaluation are documented in the rl_model directory.

## Results
The results of the EA's trading strategies and portfolio performance are documented in the results directory. This includes backtest reports, performance metrics, and visualizations.

## 12 DATA API INTEGRATION TO MT4 

A few things to note:

The {ENDPOINT} placeholder in the url variable should be replaced with the appropriate endpoint provided by 12DATA.
Error handling is basic in this example. You might want to add more robust error handling depending on your use case.
The response from 12DATA will likely be in JSON format. Parsing JSON in MQL4 isn't straightforward as there's no built-in JSON parser. Depending on what you want to achieve, you might need to implement or find a JSON parsing library compatible with MQL4.
Ensure you're abiding by 12DATA's terms of service, especially in regards to rate limiting, to avoid being blocked.
Remember, this is a basic demonstration. You'll need to adjust and expand upon this depending on the specific 12DATA features you're looking to utilize.

## Introduction

The Market Analytics EA is a MetaTrader 4 script (Expert Advisor) written in MQL4. It aims to assist forex traders in gaining deeper insights into market dynamics through various analytical tools. The script calculates and displays valuable information directly on the trading chart.

## Features

1. **Daily Market Movers**
   - Calculates the percentage change in the closing price of the current day compared to the previous day's closing price.
   - Provides a quick overview of the daily market movement for the selected currency pair.

2. **Correlation Calculation**
   - Calculates the correlation coefficient between the selected currency pair and a predefined list of major currency pairs.
   - Helps traders identify potential relationships between different currency pairs.

3. **Tick Volume Profile**
   - Displays the tick volume for the selected currency pair on a daily basis.
   - Gives insights into trading activity and liquidity over time.

4. **Cumulative Delta Calculation**
   - Calculates the cumulative delta based on the difference between closing and opening prices.
   - Offers insights into the accumulation or distribution of trades within a specified number of bars.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MetaTrader 4 platform installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of forex trading and MetaTrader 4.

### Installation

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the MetaEditor application from your MetaTrader 4 platform.

3. Import the script file `MarketAnalytics.mq4` from the downloaded repository into MetaEditor.

4. Compile the script in MetaEditor to generate the corresponding `MarketAnalytics.ex4` file.

5. Restart MetaTrader 4 and attach the compiled script to the desired currency pair chart.

## Usage
